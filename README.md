To create a user-friendly interface where users can select their departure and destination locations using autocomplete text fields, you can implement this using JavaScript and HTML in an English context. Below is an example of how you can achieve this:

To implement a calendar where users can only select today or future dates for flight bookings, and to display a relevant image if a flight is found based on the user's criteria, you can use the following approach:

![Flights](assets\3.png)

Afterwards, a loop is opened according to the selected number of customers, and the user's information is obtained.
If there are previously sold seats, it is specified and no choice is made.

![CustomerInfo](assets\4.png)

Then, a loop is initiated based on the selected number of customers to collect user information.
If there are previously sold seats, it is indicated and no selection is made







![UnavailableSeats](assets\5.png)

If the user attempts to enter an insufficient or excessive number of seats, the site will display an alert

Afterwards, the user enters payment information (assuming this will be handled by the bank, and no database operations are performed).

After the process is completed, the customer is given this message, and the necessary information to be saved in the database is recorded.
